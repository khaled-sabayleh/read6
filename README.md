# JavaScript & jQuery
THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
REPRESENTS AN HTML
PAGE 
Using the document object, you can access and change what content
users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it. 
HOW A BROWSER
SEES A WEB PAGE :
1. 1: RECEIVE A PAGE AS
HTML CODE
2. 2: CREATE A MODEL OF
THE PAGE AND STORE
IT IN MEMORY 
3. 3: USE A RENDERING
ENGINE TO SHOW THE
PAGE ON SCREEN 

All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your
instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow. 

# CREATING A BASIC
JAVASCRIPT :
1. Create a folder to put the
example in called cOl, then start
up your favorite code editor, and
enter the text to the right.
A JavaScript file is just a
text file (like HTML and CSS
files are) but it has a . j s file
extension, so save this file with
the name add-content . j s 
2.  Get the CSS and images for
this example from the website
that accompanies the book:
www.javascriptbook. com
To keep the files organized, in
the same way that CSS files
often live in a folder called
styles or css, your JavaScript
files can live in a folder called
scripts,javascript,orjs.
In this case, save your file in a
folder called j s 
3.  In your code editor, enter the
HTML shown on the left. Save
this file with the name
add-content.html
The HTML <script> element is
used to load the JavaScript file
into the page. It has an attribute
called src, whose value is the
path to the script you created.
This tells the browser to find and
load the script file (just like the
src attribute on an <i mg> tag)
  4. Open the HTML file in your
browser. You should see that the
JavaScript has added a greeting
(in this case, Good Afternoon!) to
the page. (These greetings are
coming from the JavaScript file;
they are not in the HTML file.)
  5.  Once you have tried the
example in your browser, view
the source code for the page.
(This option is usually under the
View, Tools or Develop menu of
the browser.)
  6. The source of the web page
does not actually show the new
element that has been added
into the page; it just shows the
link to the JavaScript file. 
  7. Finally, try opening the
HTML file, removing the src
attribute from the opening
<script> tag, and adding the
new code shown on the left
between the opening <script>
tag and the closing </script>
tag. The s re attribute is no
longer needed because the
JavaScript is in the HTML page. 
  8. Open the HTML file in your
web browser and the welcome
greeting is written into the page.
